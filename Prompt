DELIVERABLES (how you should answer):
1) High-level “Project Plan”.
2) Full database schema (tables + columns + relationships).
3) Routes map (public + admin).
4) Roles & permissions matrix (which role can do what).
5) Key Laravel code:
   - migrations for all main tables
   - models with relationships
   - example controllers + FormRequest classes for one full module (e.g. Shops + Categories) and User/Role management
   - example Blade templates for:
     - public home page structure
     - admin layout
     - admin shops index/create/edit
     - admin users/roles index/create/edit
   - tailwind.config.js snippet (including RTL and color palette from logo).
6) Seeders:
   - Example data for categories, one floor plan, a few demo shops, one offer, one event, facilities, a Super Admin user with credentials.
7) Short README:
   - Installation steps, how to run migrations/seeders, default admin login, how to change logo and add first real data.

IMPORTANT:
- Use the logo as the main visual anchor for colors and style (no need to recreate it, just refer to it in design).
- Keep code clean, PSR-compliant, and structured.
- Focus on making the admin UX very clear and simple for non-technical mall staff.
